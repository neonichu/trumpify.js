# trumpify.js

![MAKE EVERYTHING GREAT AGAIN](example.png)

## Usage

I am not sure, because of my lack of Java, but maybe

```bash
$ ./index.js some smart words
```

The result ends up in `tweet.png` in the current directory and will,
fingers crossed, look like the thing above. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Installation

```bash
$ brew install chromedriver
$ npm install
```

I guess you will also need [Chrome][1].
